## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Errors**
   ```bash
   # Clear Jest cache
   pnpm jest --clearCache
   
   # Restart with fresh setup
   pnpm test:health
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify .env.test file exists
   ls -la .env.test
   
   # Check environment loading
   pnpm test test/simple.test.ts
   ```

3. **Memory Issues with Large Test Suites**
   ```bash
   # Run tests with increased memory
   NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" pnpm test:all
   ```

### Performance Optimization
- Use `--maxWorkers=50%` for CI environments
- Enable `--detectOpenHandles` to find memory leaks
- Use `--forceExit` for stubborn processes

## 📝 Adding New Tests

### Creating a New Test Suite

1. **Create test file**: `test/integration/new-feature.test.ts`
2. **Add to test runner**: Update `test/test-runner.ts`
3. **Add npm script**: Update `package.json` scripts
4. **Create factories**: Add data factories if needed

### Test Structure Template

```typescript
import request from 'supertest';
import express from 'express';
import { UserFactory } from '../factories/user.factory';

describe('New Feature Tests', () => {
  let testUser: any;
  let authToken: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup test data
    testUser = await userModel.create(UserFactory.create());
    authToken = jwt.sign({ id: testUser._id }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN!);
  });

  describe('Feature Functionality', () => {
    it('should handle basic operations', async () => {
      const response = await request(app)
        .get('/api/v1/new-feature')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
        .expect(200);

      expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
    });
  });
});
```
